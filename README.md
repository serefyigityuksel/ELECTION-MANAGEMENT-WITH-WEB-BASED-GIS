Project Details : 
Turkey experienced a significant earthquake on February 6, 2023. The southeastern provinces of Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, Adıyaman, Osmaniye, Gaziantep, Şanlıurfa, Malatya, Diyarbakır, Adana, Kilis, and Elazığ were among the 11 areas devastated by the earthquake. Soon after the earthquake, my friends Tunahan Çetin and Okan Demirbilek and I presented our project idea, which we called Election Management System with Web-Based GIS, in anticipation of Turkey's impending general election. Our goal was to find a solution for the transportation, supply, and coordination issues that could arise in the region as a result of the earthquake. 

The interface's primary function is to allow voters in the area to view the polling places set up with the use of Geographic Information Systems and cast their ballots by presenting their ID card. Upon clicking on the website, you will see that the "show chests" button located in the left sidebar allows you to view all of the information about the chests in your city. We used Leaflet and React to build the app.
